Use python-pptx to edit PowerPoint slides

## Command to use this module in CUI (Mac's Terminal or Windows cmd):

### NOTE: You can compare as many PowerPoint files as you want (as long as your system can handle it). The differences are shown in CUI and a CSV file comparing these files are saved in the same directory. Alternatively, if only one PowerPoint file is specified, it still give you text contents of the file.
